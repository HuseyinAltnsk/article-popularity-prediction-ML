This project focused on using machine learning to predict the popularity of a given piece of news article using existing datasets. In this project, we tested three regression models: \texttt{Linear Support Vector Regression}, \texttt{Random Forest Regressor} (RFR), and \texttt{Lasso Regression}. After conducting a series of experiments using these models, we ranked their performances based on the results of news article popularity prediction. We found that \texttt{LinearSVR} performed the best, with an r2 score of over $0.8$. This was true for both articles from ``Moreover" and ``Opoint", our two major data source. The best model used a combination of grid search with cross-validation. We think this project can be used to support the media and entertainment industry's efforts in producing contents that generate high volumes of readers, and can help many businesses better understand readers' interest.
